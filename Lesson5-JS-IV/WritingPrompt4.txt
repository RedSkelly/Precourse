Callback Functions:
Functions can be passed around like objects. A callback function is the passing of functions as arguments to other functions.

`arguments`:
keyword that can be implemented to pass all arguments when one passes to a function

`prototype`:
Every class has a `prototype` property. When setting methods on `prototype`, all objects declared will have access to those methods.

Constructors:
 allow objects to be organized in a way that allows them to share properties and methods. More efficient than having to keep calling multiple objects for the properties/methods they contain.
